This is an **early exploration** of the solution space for [the problem space](README.md) under [the threat model](privacy_threat_model.md). It contains an enumeration of alternatives under consideration and an evolving analysis of their properties.

From [the privacy threat model](privacy_threat_model.md) perspective, we have found useful to separate two distinct uses of federation, namely enterprise use cases and consumer use cases.

We'll deep dive into each separately, because we think there are fairly difference mitigations for each:

- [Consumers](consumers.md) and
- [Enterprises](enterprises.md)
