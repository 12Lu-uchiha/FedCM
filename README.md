> not to be confused with [this](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/) WebID whose authors have [graciously](https://github.com/WICG/WebID/issues/54#issuecomment-783605484) allowed us to use this as a codename until we [find](https://github.com/WICG/WebID/issues/41#issuecomment-712304910) a better one

This is an **active** exploration to react to the **ongoing** privacy-oriented changes in browsers (e.g. [1](https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/), [2](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/09/03/todays-firefox-blocks-third-party-tracking-cookies-and-cryptomining-by-default/) and [3](https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sustainability-and-the-importance-of-and/)) and **preserve** and **elevate** identity federation (e.g. OpenID, OAuth and SAML) for a more private Web.

This explainer is divided in three (big) sections:

1. What's the [problem](problem.md)?
1. Where we [ought](proposal.md) to be?
1. Where do we [start](https://wicg.github.io/WebID)?
1. [How](roadmap.md) do we get there?
