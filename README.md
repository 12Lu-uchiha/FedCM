This is a proposal for a new API that will allow websites ([relying parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relying_party), or RPs) to access verified identity information about a user in a consensual and privacy-preserving manner.

Initially this API will serve to permit browser intermediation of existing federated sign-in flows on the web, over [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) or [SAML](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html), between RPs and federated [identity providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider) (IDPs for short). It will also add flexibility in the future for user agents to support identity protocols with better privacy properties.
