<h2>Notes - Day One</h2>
<h3><strong>Problems and Solutions from the Browser Perspective</strong></h3>
<h4>Mozilla Firefox Johann &amp; Peter [slides]</h4>
<p>Peter:</p>
<p>We have some history here: Persona, federated identity system.
Inspiration to some of webid. Closed in 2016.
<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_AAR"><u>https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_AAR</u></a></p>
<p>Browser - centric approach in Persona. Decentralized identity is a
challenge. Wasn’t simple enough. Forced some of UX onto websites; didn’t
go over well. These were lessons learned.</p>
<p><img src="mozilla-screenshot-1.png" alt="screenshot">
Concerned about new tracking vectors. Decentralization, not privileging
live organizations that have pre-existing solutions. New idps should be
allowed to exist.</p>
<p>Contractual relationship should not be necessary.</p>
<p>Handing off to Johann.</p>
<p>Johann: The main thing we’ve been doing is protecting our users from
cross site tracking.</p>
<p><img src="mozilla-screenshot-2.png" alt="screenshot"></p>
<p>Not currently happy with set of existing solutions; interested in
exploring long term solutions to cross site cookies, etc, getting rid of
heuristics. Storage Access API might be a temporary solution.</p>
<p>Peter: We have talked to many teams that have challenges with auth flow
with storage access api. Persona is dead. Interested in learning more
about use cases.</p>
<h4>Microsoft Edge (Melanie,Erik) [slides]</h4>
<p>Melanie PM on Edge team</p>
<p>Goal protecting user privacy on the web: did user interviews. The users
wanted more transparency &amp; control over how their data is collected and
used. Value privacy &amp; productivity.</p>
<p>Promise: protection, transparency, control, and respect; implement with
Tracker blocking, storage access API blocking/access choice, surfacing,
cookies storage to users</p>
<p>“Core use cases of the web” must just work to ensure the productivity</p>
<p><strong>vNextFederated Auth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Protect against cross site tracking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IDP/RP enlightenment - directed identifiers interesting, but conflicts with some use cases; browser should help surface the risks and what’s happening</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let’s limit browser specific tracking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we keep innovation possible and not lock out new insights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mitigate breakage of existing sites</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Incubating IsLoggedIn with W3C Privacy CG</p>
<p>Contributed the Storage Access API to Chromium (but it’s not activated
in Chrome); curious about something like that for identity-specific
flows</p>
<p>Question: WIll ad customization through consented tracking of interests
be considered?</p>
<p>A: Not in webID, other groups are discussing.</p>
<p>Heather: Interesting thing to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Erik A: The current thinking is just to break passive tracking. Might be
something to revisit maybe.</p>
<h4>Google Chrome [<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xK1x7EGX2wG57Cup2sVkASdDDQeySRuKQ2if4bcVg0c/edit#slide=id.gd7e9c918c6_0_0"><u>slides</u></a>]</h4>
<p>Sam Goto: WebID and the Privacy Sandbox</p>
<p>Hopeful as there is a good amount of common goals in the browser
presentations.</p>
<p>Privacy sandbox to prevent 3rd party tracking, fingerprinting.</p>
<p>Recommends
<a href="https://github.com/michaelkleber/privacy-model"><u>https://github.com/michaelkleber/privacy-model</u></a></p>
<p>Want to see the web more private with more federation.</p>
<p>Federation designed on top of the primitives that also enable cross site
tracking: can’t distinguish between the two. Classification problem!</p>
<p>Social widgets, personalized buttons, session management break with
third party cookie changes; Bounce tracking just looks like SSO login!</p>
<p>RP tracking problem: what about the IdP passing on global identifiers
and the SP colluding to develop tracking across sites. IdP tracking: And
the IDP knows all the places you have authenticated too!</p>
<p>-- WebId? WebSign-in? Name is changing! --</p>
<p>Useful principles</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Users first, developers 2nd, browser 3rd, purity 4th</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privacy by default</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Classes of solution</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ask for permission - backwards compatible but ineffective to drive change</p>
<ul>
<li>Permission blindness -- so many prompts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mediation - browsers take control of some parts by rendering as visible in browser</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delegation - an IdP running in the browsers, tokens in the browser</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unbundle global identification into directed identification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unbundle issuing and presentation</p>
<ul>
<li>User agent given a token from IdP; user agent creates derived tokens to grant to RP such that correlation by RPs not possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Timeline</p>
<p>Early 2020 - reached out to WICG &amp; OIDF, developed 3 options, prototyping, - 2021 - TODAY</p>
<h4>Apple Webkit - John Wilander</h4>
<p>Apple is working in some of these standard groups too. Apple used a 24 hr limit for 3rd party cookies: if a user visited a first party website within 24 hours, the website's cookies would be passed on in cross-site situations.</p>
<p>Storage Access API has some popup consent for authN purposes.</p>
<p>IsLoggedIn proposal similar to WebId -- some way to distinguish authN flows</p>
<h3>BREAK</h3>
<h3>Identity Provider use cases (20min each)</h3>
<p>We were not able to address the Enterprise, Higher Ed, SAML usecases look like? Weren’t able to schedule not that this is not important. Many more conversations we need to be having.</p>
<h4>Microsoft Identity - Hirsch Singhal [slides]</h4>
<p>Hirsch owns OAuth - both consumer (Live, etc) &amp; Enterprise (Azure)</p>
<p>300 domains Office, Azure, and Consumer (onedrive.live.com, xbox.com, etc)</p>
<p>Auth has three domains -- plus all the enterprise SAML domains</p>
<p>Cross domain important for cloud provider to customers.</p>
<p>Consumer privacy in direct conflict with enterprise requirements. Seamless “invisible” SSO is desired, minimizing UX churn between all the work applications is important.</p>
<p>Customers paying for reliability -- if Microsoft breaks RPs they owe money to customers. More prompts would be “breaking”.</p>
<p>Microsoft working on their own relying parties …</p>
<p>Silent token refresh, implicit flow, broken. Move to auth code flow. No need for cookies, use refresh tokens. -- this has some shortcomings.</p>
<p>Fixing 3rd party means</p>
<p>Azure needs to revoke on demand, refresh tokens can’t be, so now IdP having to track at all RPs so that Azure can let RPs know and revoke. Force reload of applications because of the refresh token needs.</p>
<p>Multi-frame apps - aka - Teams -- broken with third party tokens going away.</p>
<p>Independent iframes with applets and widgets can be used third party cookies to allow sharing the sign in. Note third party may be legal third party or just a different domain for the same first party.</p>
<p>Iframes talk to each other through a broker: parent frame gets tokens for child apps on their behalf. This may be broken as privacy and security enforcements occur: will demand users to experience more ux flows…</p>
<p>All auth flows are being upgraded in light of solar winds - -new browser standards will need to be able to deal with responding to security (via extensibility)</p>
<p>Need enterprise controls for parity for enterprise security</p>
<h4>Facebook - Brad Hill</h4>
<p>Started in 1994, 2005 for infocard at Microsoft, consulting, RSA in 2011…. More details …. PayPal &amp; Fido Alliance … then security keys at Facebook. So comments not just Facebook. Strong security focus.</p>
<p>W3C constituency prioritization better visualized as an ecosystem, winning designs keep all the needs in balance. Needs for Relying Parties must be kept in mind or the Relying Parties will opt out of federated
identity. Business and IdPs demand security controls that may not be first in mind for users, but directly benefits the users. Values exchanges are indirect and may not be as obvious. Need business models that will support the parties to continue to operate.</p>
<p>Disintermediating IdPs and SPs -- look at multiple attempts in the past. Drivers Licenses are not the best example because threat models and regulation online are different than physical world. Stolen Drivers license has far less of an impact than online authentication.</p>
<p>Mission critical for employees to cross org boundaries, intranets; need to have regulation controls and threat controls to meet legal
requirements.</p>
<p>The threat statement for WebId omits all the threats of theft of credentials and a broad suite of threats IdPs and Sps spend time to defeat.</p>
<p>Apple enforcement of webkit and other auth points analyzed &amp; criticized.</p>
<p>Browsers may be the user’s agent, but they are developed by other companies that have business and competitive interests.</p>
<p>TEXT OF REMARKS WILL BE SHARED.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, my name is Brad Hill. I usually dislike introductions, but the
rhetoric around browsers and privacy in recent years has again been
turned to metaphors of war, so I feel I should give some of my
background or I fear those who don’t know me will judge what I say too
much by my current affiliation.</p>
<p>I started developing for the Web in 1994. I started working on
identity technology in 2005 as an outside consultant working to review
InfoCard inside Microsoft. It inspired me to develop a security
consulting practice focused on SSO solutions, publish my own research
on weaknesses in XML Digital Signatures and Public Key Kerberos at
BlackHat, and a 10 year literature survey of identity system failure
modes at the RSA conference in 2011.</p>
<p>I’ve been involved at W3C on security topics since 2007, worked on the
Web PKI at IETF, ICANN and as the only relying party representative in
the CA/Browser Forum. At PayPal I was a leader in the early
development of the FIDO Alliance and the first round of FIDO standards
for strong and privacy preserving authentication. At Facebook I led
it’s early deployments of security keys, and developed an open
protocol for secure and privacy-focused account recovery after
password loss. In 2018 I took over as the lead engineer for Facebook
Login, the role I still hold today.</p>
<p>My perspective on identity on the web spans multiple decades and
several generations of technology, in both offensive and defensive
roles, always in a practical capacity against real adversaries, and
always with a goal to reduce real harm to end users, and I want to
offer my remarks today more in the spirit of the things I have learned
in that time than focus narrowly on Facebook’s implementation
specifics.</p>
<hr>
<p>Early on in the WebID explainer, the HTML priority of constituencies
is referenced as a guiding principle:</p>
<p>“When there is a conflict in interests of the parties involved, we
think the following is the right order of constituencies: users first
(https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies),
developers second (relying parties and identity providers, in that
order), browser engines third and technical purity fourth.”</p>
<p>The priority of constituencies is one of the things I admire most
about the W3C, but is something I have come to believe we lean on too
early and too often. It creates a frame of *zero-sum conflict* that
does not always lead to productive and sustainable outcomes. Really,
the priority of constituencies is a strategy of *last resort*. It is
rare that interests of these constituencies are directly in conflict.</p>
<p>Rather, we ought to think of a multi-stakeholder system like federated
identity as an *ecosystem* where users, identity providers, and
relying parties all have their own fitness functions and incentives,
and successful systems are not those that pick winners based on
relative moral standing, but those that effectively *balance* the
needs and benefits of all participants. The ecosystem will fail to
thrive - and even the morally privileged participants will derive no
benefits - if any of the necessary parties isn’t incentivized to
participate.</p>
<p>As an example, Facebook several years ago launched an “Anonymous
Login” product, to fantastic reviews from end-users and privacy
advocates. But I’m sure that nobody here has ever used it - because it
failed almost immediately. No businesses wanted this product - it
didn’t meet their needs. End users derived zero benefit from the
product, even though it put user needs first, because it didn’t strike
the right balance with relying party value. In a more recent example,
we saw a number of businesses abandon federated sign in entirely for
their apps, rather than be forced to implement Sign In With Apple,
because they judged the cost/benefit to be wrong for them. If we don’t
consider the needs of relying parties - and they are often
underrepresented in these forums - they will opt-out of the systems we
build and fall back to least-common-denominator email and password
sign in.</p>
<p>User-centric prioritization also doesn’t mean exclusively what the
user tells you they want. The end user doesn’t think when they create
an account today that six months later they might forget which
provider or method they used, that they may have closed their account
at the original identity provider, have switched browsers, will want
to use a different identity provider today to access the same relying
party account, or will need to be notified of and protected from a
security breach. Businesses and identity providers know about and
demand solutions for these problems, but these are still user-centric
values that need to be balanced against other user utilities like
tracking protection.</p>
<p>Incentives to identity providers also matter! A lot! Building,
maintaining and operating a Web-scale identity provider is not free.
It is important to think about why an organization would bear the
cost, what incentives do the models of federation offer, and what that
implies for other members of the ecosystem. Nobody really charges
directly for acting as an identity provider today - though password
managers have found some success in an adjacent market. So the value
exchange is always indirect - but it matters what options for value
exchange exist, how transparent they are to end users and businesses,
and how proximate they are to the actual identity transaction.
Advertising is pretty unpopular right now, but the value exchange is
pretty clear to all involved and very proximate to the user’s choice.
Treating the identity provider as the users’ adversary in the design
of a system, instead of as part of a system of value exchange for
mutual benefit, doesn’t present many options for a balanced ecosystem.
Fewer viable business models for identity providers means reduced
competition, innovation and user choice. The alienation of value
exchange from the identity transaction will reduce incentives to
invest by those that remain. And the business incentives that can fund
ongoing identity provider operations through 3rd order effects may be
opaque and user-hostile - things like preserving the status quo of
email as a primary online identifier despite it’s terrible privacy
properties and the revealed preference of the most recent and next
billion users for alternatives - or using identity and authentication
technology to lock users in to the identity provider’s browser, device
or operating system, or to privilege adjacent products like payments.</p>
<hr>
<p>The proposal to dis-intermediate Identity Providers from knowledge of
credential use has additional issues. While the idea of decoupling
presentation of verifiable claims from their issuance has been around
since Brands’ original paper in 1993 on blinded signatures, and has
resurfaced repeatedly in technologies like CardSpace and U-Prove,
there is something to learn from their failure to gain traction in the
market, as well as the fact that the things they purport to enable
have nonetheless thrived in their absence. The drivers’ license is not
a good model for online identity. The online world is different than
the physical world - the threat models are different, the utility is
different, and people bring different expectations to how they want
their identity and credentials handled. One of the clearest takeaways
from the Cambridge Analytica saga is that people, and their
representatives in government, expect identity providers to police the
relying party ecosystem by entering into and enforcing contracts
governing the exchange and use of user data, even with those users’
explicit consent. Users expect and regulators demand that they be able
to see a list of where they have connected their identity, what
information they have shared, and how to contact those relying
parties. Regulation like the GDPR requires users be able to issue
requests to relying parties for deletion of data they’ve previously
shared.</p>
<p>In the physical world, it’s rare that your drivers license gets
stolen, and there are limits to the damage that can be done, how
valuable it actually is as an authenticator, and the rate at which it
can be abused. Digital credential breaches are common, can be abused
at scale and speed, and end users rely critically on identity
providers to keep them safe, limit and remediate damage by retaining
an audit trail of where credentials and data were shared, to detect
and rapidly invalidate abused credentials, and terminate sessions at
relying parties created while an account was compromised. This can’t
simply rely on the user agent to assist because the attacker does not
share the victim’s user agent. These regulatory and practical
obligations around user security, safety and trust make relying-party
blinding impossible to adopt for some identity providers.</p>
<p>Consider also, that federated identity in standard browsers is mission
critical infrastructure today for nearly every global worker using
information technology. Enterprise boundaries are no longer defined by
networks; the services used to do our jobs cross organizational
boundaries all the time, transparently to the end-user, as well as
moving between intranets and the public Web. The perimeter of the
modern enterprise is identity and enterprise identity providers have
obligations to understand the scope and patterns of user activity at
relying parties for security, compliance and licensing reasons, and
providing non-directed identifiers is most often mandatory and part of
the essential value delivered in these contexts, including for BYOD
environments.</p>
<p>On this subject, for both enterprise as well as consumer use cases, I
must note that I find it rather shocking that the threat model
document for WebID only includes relying parties and identity
providers, described exclusively as threats to the user, and does not
apparently contemplate at all the goals, capabilities and user harms
from actual criminals using phishing, malware, account compromise and
other techniques, and the tradeoffs that defending the user against
their chosen IdPs and RPs implies for essential methods in the field
today to reduce harms by these other threat actors.</p>
<p>Similarly, throughout the documents, basic things like maintenance of
state by websites is considered exclusively as a threat to users,
ignoring that fraud and abuse detection and prevention, stronger
authentication, the reduction of friction from multi-factor
authentication, or the ability to do simple tasks like fill a shopping
cart anonymously, use the same mechanisms to mitigate against threats
to user privacy and security of equal or greater consequence than
“tracking”.</p>
<hr>
<p>The explainer articulates as another part of its problem statement as:
“existing user authentication flows were designed on top of
general-purpose web platform capabilities such as top-level
navigations/redirects with parameters, window popups, iframes and
cookies.”</p>
<p>Building user value on general purpose capabilities is commonly known
as an “over the top” protocol, and is a fundamental pattern and
principle that has made the Internet and the Web successful.</p>
<p>This style of building enables permission-less innovation and a more
level and competitive playing field, open to all. OTT protocols are
more difficult for intermediaries like network operators, browser or
device vendors to manipulate in order to capture rents, block or
disadvantage competitors, privilege their own solutions or lock
customers in precisely because their broad value proposition makes
them difficult to target or remove without broader consequences.</p>
<p>We should therefore be very cautious about proposals to extract,
classify and directly mediate such interactions for identity on the
web. Firstly, we must leave room for innovation and competition.
Secondly, we must be careful about non-user-centric consequences which
this specialization could empower. We are in the midst of, and indeed
this work is in no small sense directly triggered by, a play by a
major OS and device vendor to use its market power to wield control
over identity and authentication as a “primary strategy” to raise
switching costs for its device owners, disadvantage competitors - even
in adjacent markets, and dictate the business model of developers on
its operating system.</p>
<p>We have already seen, for example, Apple mandate that developers who
offer federated authentication for apps in its App Store, not just
offer an option with certain privacy properties, but rather, take
Apple’s particular federation product. In response, a non-trivial
number of apps have abandoned federation altogether. We simultaneously
see Apple continuing to enforce a browser engine monopoly on its iOS
platform, and use that to force fundamental changes to how cookies and
user storage are managed, even in 3rd party browser shells and in-app
web experiences. It’s not hard to imagine a world a few years further
down the strategic merger path of OSX and iOS on Apple silicon where
WebKit is the mandatory browser engine even for desktop systems. Why
should we trust that Apple won’t apply the same strategy to federated
identity on the Web it did in the App Store: only allowing sites to
use mediation in WebKit if they offer Apple’s preferred product as an
option, or refusing to mediate on behalf of websites or competitive
identity providers without imposing their own terms and conditions on
the user relationship? Will those terms include bundling of other
products that will further undermine the independence of the web and
web site operators? We’ve already seen Apple threaten to revoke
access, on the web, to the Sign In with Apple system it forced Epic to
accept, after Epic entered into an unrelated dispute with it over
payment processing fees.</p>
<p>Indeed, the potential for such is not limited to Apple - most browser
market share is controlled today by large companies with broad and
diverse commercial interests. Yes, it’s the user’s agent, but browsers
are also sophisticated and costly software projects that respond to
the incentives of the organizations that fund them.</p>
<p>Similar to the ideas of permission-less innovation and over-the-top
protocols as being core to the success of the Internet and Web, the
articulation of principle in the WebID explainer “that cross-origin
communication is a privileged operation and needs to be intermediated
by your user agent.” is antithetical to the core ideas of the Web as a
series of linked pages and applications. That is where the very power
of the web comes from. Linking between different contexts is the most
basic primitive defining the Web! Accepting this principle gives far
too much power to browser vendors to dictate the terms on which
innovation and business can take place on the open web.</p>
<p>While we are currently in the midst of a moral panic about many
aspects of the Internet, “tracking” among them, we ought to carefully
consider the incredible benefit to humanity the Web has brought and
continues to bring, weigh the risks to that against the harms the
WebID explainer identifies as in need of redress - and be humble and
cautious when tinkering with the basic mechanisms and principles
behind the Web’s success, let alone rebuking them entirely. Blocking
passive tracking is a good goal, but when we turn to active user
choices, it is likely overreach to say that the only acceptable
interactions between consenting parties on the Web can be those which
a browser can constrain and verify technically and deterministically,
rather than providing a general platform on which contracts,
regulation and trust provide a nuanced and flexible overlay to help
balance different interests.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h4>Google Sign-in - Vishnu K [slides]</h4>
<p>Our goal has been due to a variety of challenges, poor identity
experiences exist. We want to solve them from user and dev standpoint.
Identity as a barrier. You have to sign up to check out, save state,
etc. Then once you do, protecting id is challenging.</p>
<p>Password reuse is common. Interactions sometimes abandoned by identity
issues.</p>
<p>Increasing complexity causing a difficulty in saving state. Like booking
an airfare without signing in, might disappear when you do. Dropping
cookies, etc, can lead to frustrating user experiences.</p>
<p>Main solution to solve these problems is (does not work with opt out).
Google sign in flow (see slide). User must provide consent.</p>
<p>Sign in is automatic. Many things affect federation ecosystem.</p>
<p>Heather: Anyone from apple to talk about Apple sign-in?</p>
<p>Tess: nope</p>
<h3>BREAK</h3>
<h3>Wrap Up Day One</h3>
<h4>Consider the questions for Day Two (scribe -- lee graber)</h4>
<p>Heather -- Go through questions and clarify what we discuss for
tomorrow. What needs to be fleshed out</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GPDR requires IDP … How will Idps do this with disconnected RPs --
How are the different proposals considering GDPR requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sam Goto -- (answer) Identified 3 variations (not mutually exclusive) … permission vs mediation oriented will give access to name which should satisfy GDPR. Should give same answer as today. Delegation variation … don’t have answer yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heather -- Not having all the answers makes it hard for updates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sam -- Agree with Brad’s remarks on permissionless. Expect to co-exist. Permission variation allows innovation and backwards compat. Slowly things bake towards mediation and eventually  maybe towards delegation. All solutions have pros/cons and nothing is perfect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kai -- Not only required to log consent but also to which RP. Have to log each and every transfer and potentially revoke and notify RP to delete data on their end</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heather -- Good point for being ready for tomorrow. Question as to whether 100% backwards compat is ‘true’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heather -- other questions on workflow should be handled as part of some of that discussion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sam -- not necessarily 100% backwards compat but permission variation is ‘safey hatch’. Cost is permission prompt and need to find ways to make permission prompt effective</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it conceivable that browsers mediating/owning the identity flows is not actually the desired objective?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Brian Campbell -- it appeared that this was a goal and was pushing back to ask if this is really desired or came from the browser vendors themselves. As an end user, would prefer the user agent be less “aware of me”. Prefer using web primitives. Wanted to expand conversation / pushback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heather -- Seems like perhaps there were some underlying assumptions and wasn’t clear what they all were. One appears to be that browsers are in the middle and should be responsible for mediation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tim Cappali -- Not clear whose assumptions there are. Web community, Browser vendors, Google, … Confusion comes from who forms these assumptions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brian -- How these assumptions are manifested in different browsers makes it hard for people developing for the web when it is not “a platform”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sam -- (hint) Yes … it is conceivable that there are other options to solve the problem. Open to hear alternative ways to solve problem (tracking on the web). We are all ears. Mediation is not a presupposition on the web.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>User provisioning workflows should be covered under GDPR discussion</p>
<ul>
<li>Hrish -- understanding how SCIM operates when you can’t talk about the user is interesting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Heather) Focus is on privacy as a sole threat to the point of ignoring the other threats. Are we solving tracking at the expense of making other threat mitigations worse (per some of Brad’s comments)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safari changes doesn’t mean it is all working (can just mean that people are told not to use Safari) -- no real discussion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idp communication authorization attributes for end user access, how will authZ work when it is decoupled from AuthN</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sam -- Thought some about separating AuthZ from AuthN. Permission prompt is an escape hatch. Mediation thinking of decoupling openID scope from other scopes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brad -- Facebook has experimented with limited success (separation). Users know what they are signing into and what it should need. Increase user success by putting interactions together where they all make sense. (not separating).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>George Fletcher -- AuthN &amp; AuthZ all combinations are real use cases. Can have a simpe SAML assertion that just says I am a student but not who I am. Can also just have authN and then both together. Need to be really careful about thinking about separating them. Forcing them to be separate would be a really bad user experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sam -- Separating is a choice of the IDP and RP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>George -- Make sure we think about use case and user experience. We need to design and build to enable best user experience</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>⅔ browsers presenting are also ad-tech interests and use tracking methods not included in the “readme”s. Is this a conflict?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sam -- very valid question to explore. Mental model - user agent has lots of information about where you have been, your inputs. From a threat model perspective, UA has had this privilege for while. Useful to unroll this question</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Id tokens are signed by IDP and checked by RP. What happens when UA is “man in the middle”</p>
<ul>
<li>Sam -- this is referring to the delegation model. “Easy answer” -- there is a long form document on this that is far from ‘done’. It is ‘directionally correct’. Gets inspiration for Personas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enterprise / workforce use case differs from other discussions. (captures both of Lee’s questions)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unintentionally … come back to (Heather)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meditation flow … can you explain technical details of browser blindness safeguards</p>
<ul>
<li>No comments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Email address is usually used to identify users, doesn’t that need Idp support to support multiple identities with different email addresses</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kai Lehman -- User agent has different emails with different identities. Idp needs to support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sam -- Good question. Idp could provide proxying (apple sign in). Email provider could provide proxying. Or Browsers could run extensions that do email forwarding. There are more possibilities than just IDps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kai -- But Idp had to verify the emails and so can assure the RP. If end user can just set up any email address … the trust goes away</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brad -- Facebook offered proxied email and abandoned it. Very hard and barrier to entry. You obtain bad reputation for …</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Heather) Including regulatory perspective question with GDPR as part of general ‘legal’ questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>George Fletcher -- how do you manage relationship so that IDP knows the user said yes. If it is handled by the browser, is the IDP know longer liable? Creates an interesting dynamic that might require lawyers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there any hope of consolidating where this work is happening</p>
<ul>
<li>Heather -- reached out to privacy CG, IDPro, OpenID foundation, higher ed, … so many groups. Don’t know that it can be consolidated. Too many nested implications. Would like central place to keep tabs. If I was queen of the universe, it would be hub and spoke so central knows where work is happening and what each group is focused on. There is enough expertise in
<blockquote>
<p>each area to have deep dives but need to come back to central
to communicate decisions to understand impact. Discuss further
tomorrow</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Heather -- Good picture for tomorrow. Conversations. Not presentations.
Dive into questions. Latter half of the day discuss where are
conversations happening now and how do we take this forward (not lose
momentum). Thank everyone!</p>
