<h1>Delegation-oriented API</h1>
<p>This approach attempts to provide technical enforcements of <a href="glossary.md#identity-provider-blindness">Identity Provider<br>
blindness</a> by having the IDP delegate<br>
the generation of identity assertion to the browser.</p>
<p>Below is one variation that combines the IDP blindness mechanisms designed in<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Persona">Mozillaâ€™s Personas proposal</a><br>
with the <a href="glossary.md#relying-party-blindness">RP blindness</a>, recovery processes<br>
and the user-behavior backwards compatibility. This approach maximizes the<br>
technical enforcement of both RP and IDP tracking, at the cost of IDP and RP<br>
server-side backwards compatibility.</p>
<h2>Basic Flow</h2>

</figure>
<p>Notice that in this approach we are assuming that an email proxy and email<br>
provider exist independent from the IDP. This is necessary to maintain IDP<br>
blindness even after RP uses the directed email address to email the user.</p>
<p>Below is the sign up flow in this proposal where a user signs up to an RP and<br>
share their <a href="glossary.md#directed-basic-profile">directed basic profile</a>. The<br>
importance of recovery code and salt are discussed in the next section.</p>

<p>Description of the steps involved in this flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>RP initiates the sign-up through<br>
<a href="consumers.md#the-consumer-api">the consumer API</a></li>
<li>Browser obtains the designated IDP endpoint as declared in a <code>.well-known</code><br>
configuration.</li>
<li>Browser sends the user to the designated IDP end point to obtain the global<br>
account and a list of directed accounts for the current user.
<ul>
<li>Note that the RP is not exposed to the IDP.</li>
<li>As part of this step IDP may show UI and authenticate the user.</li>
<li>In this example the list of directed accounts is empty given that this is<br>
a first sign-up moment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Browser sees no directed account in the IDP response and initiates its<br>
account creation process.
<ul>
<li>It is possible that the directed accounts list is not empty and has a<br>
matching entry for the current RP. This occurs for a retuning user sign-in<br>
and means that the browser already has account details including a private<br>
key for the user and can skip most of the following steps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Browser coordinates with Email Proxy service to obtain a directed email for<br>
the user.
<ul>
<li>This step only assumes that an Email Proxy separate from the IDP exists.<br>
This process may involves additional steps which are not relevant at this<br>
stage. See [#decoupling-idp-from-email-services] for more details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Browser generates a new key pair and a random salt value.</li>
<li>Browser sends the public key, salt, and directed email address to the IDP.</li>
<li>IDP return a certificate signed with its own private key. The certificate<br>
includes browser generated public key, and directed email.
<ul>
<li>IDP remembers [browser public key, directed email, and salt] as a new<br>
directed account for the user. This is used for future sign-ins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Browser receives the certification and adds the new directed account to its<br>
database.</li>
<li>Browser creates a recovery code for the new account in its database.
<ul>
<li>Recover code is <code>SHA512(alice, salt, RP)</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Browser generates an <a href="#certified-jwt">Certified JWT</a> as <code>id_token</code> and signs<br>
it with its own privte key.
<ul>
<li>The token includes [directed identifier, directed email, and the recovery<br>
code].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Browser returns the certified <code>id_token</code> to RP.</li>
<li>RP verifies the certified <code>id_token</code> and signs up the user.
<ul>
<li>The verification process involves both the browser public key and the IDP<br>
public key. Additional details are available in the<br>
<a href="#rp-backend-verification">RP backend verification section</a>.</li>
<li>RP stores the recovery code in addition to the user directed identifier.<br>
The recovery code allows RP to sign in the user even in absence of FedCM.<br>
See <a href="#recovery-flow">recovery flow</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Maximum IDP and RP tracking preventions using technical enforcement.</p>
<p>From a UX perspective, we expect this to have the lowest privacy-introduced<br>
friction/consent, since both RP and IDP tracking problems are addressed<br>
mechanically.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<h3>Server-side Backward compatibility</h3>
<p>This approach requires changes in the RP backends:</p>
<ul>
<li>This approach requires a new token format which is no longer backward<br>
compatible with the OpenID JWT. This means that the token verification<br>
libraries on the RP backends need to be updated. While we can do our best to<br>
make the change small, all RPs are  still required to redeploy. In contrast,<br>
earlier explored flows only require IDP sdk and backend updates.</li>
<li>The RP needs to maintain a recovery token for each account. This is necessary<br>
to enable the ability for users to sign-in to their account on platforms that<br>
don't have FedCM or after they switch browsers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>UX Complication</h3>
<p>With this proposal the sign-in user experience on RP would remain the same in<br>
particular a) users can sign in to RP by selecting an IDP and b) users can sign<br>
in to their existing account with RP even on platforms that do not support FedCM<br>
by falling back to OpenID and removing IDP blindness restriction.</p>
<p>However the user experience on IDP side changes. In particular users are no<br>
longer able to see and manage all the RPs they have signed up with through their<br>
IDP control panel. Browsers may be able to provide a similar UX. Most likely<br>
scenario is that both browser and IDP would end up managing some account which<br>
can be a source of confusion.</p>
<h3>Decoupling IDP from Email Services</h3>
<p>A <a href="glossary.html#directed-basic-profile">directed email address</a> requires an<br>
email proxy service in addition to the email provider.</p>
<p>One option is for the email provider to be the email proxy as well. This seems<br>
like a reasonable option.</p>
<p>Another seemingly natural option would be to have the IDP provide the email<br>
proxy service. However this can weaken the IDP blindness if IDP is also either<br>
the email proxy or email provider. This is beucase most RPs send a welcome email<br>
to their users on account creation.</p>
<p>So to mitigate this risk, we envision an entity (or entities) different from the<br>
IDP is responsible for proxying email and keeping the user inbox. At this stage<br>
and for the purpose of the flows discussed here, we simply assume the key<br>
property that separate IDP and Email Proxy/Provider exists and paper over the<br>
details of how a directed email address is created and verified across email<br>
proxy, email provider and IDP.</p>
<h3>RP account management complexity</h3>
<p>Directed emails notably increase account management complexity for RPs since<br>
many users are not be able to readily recall their directed email address. This<br>
proposal adds even more complexity to this by introducing email proxy to the<br>
mix.</p>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<h3>IDP/RP Blindness Enforcement</h3>
<ul>
<li>the IDP is not aware of the RP that the user is signing in. This is achieved<br>
by having the IDP certify a browser controlled public key whose private key<br>
can be used to mint new tokens on IDP's behalf.</li>
<li>This enforced IDP blindness may be reverted when it becomes necessary. We<br>
belive one such necessary use case is to allow a user to sign in to their<br>
account on platforms that do not support FedCM.</li>
<li>the RP is always blind as it receives directed id and directed email.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>Here is the database for each of the participating entities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Browser</strong>: RP, IDP, global user id, private/public key pair, global email, directed email, salt, IDP certificate</li>
<li><strong>Email Proxy</strong>: directed email, global email</li>
<li><strong>IDP</strong>: user id, directed id, directed email, public key, salt</li>
<li><strong>RP</strong>: directed email, directed id, recovery code</li>
</ul>
<h3>RP Backend Verification</h3>
<p>Normally the RP verifies the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">JWT</a> (JSON Web Token) on its backend by checking<br>
its signature against the IDP public key. However the new proposed Certified JWT<br>
contains, in its header, a browser generated public key which is certified by<br>
the IDP. So the verification process first verifies the included public key with<br>
the IDP public key and then verifies the token using this public key.</p>
<h4>Certified JWT</h4>
<p>Here is a strawman proposal for a Certified JWT:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">
{
  header: {
    &quot;alg&quot;: &quot;ES512&quot;,
    &quot;typ&quot;: &quot;JWT&quot;,
    /* new entry in header */
    &quot;certified-public-key&quot;: {
      &quot;value&quot;: &quot;MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG&quot;,
      &quot;signature&quot;:  ECDSASHA512(
          &quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot;,
          &quot;&lt;idp-private-key&gt;&quot;
      ),
    }
  },
  payload: {
    &quot;sub&quot;: &quot;1234567890&quot;,
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
    &quot;admin&quot;: true,
    &quot;iat&quot;: 1516239022,
    /* new entry in payload */
    &quot;recovery&quot;: ECDSASHA512(&quot;&lt;user_id&gt;&quot;, RP, &quot;&lt;salt&gt;&quot;)
  },

  signature: ECDSASHA512(
    base64(header) + &quot;.&quot; + base64(payload),
    &quot;&lt;browser-private-key&gt;&quot;)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Recovery Flow</h3>
<p>Recovery code is an opaque value that can be computed given user id, RP site,<br>
and a salt value e.g., <code>recovery code = SHA512(user_id, RP, salt)</code>.</p>
<p>The recovery code is kept at the RP. But it may be passed to the IDP to uniquely<br>
identify the user. This means that an RP and IDP may be able to identify the<br>
user if they directly or indirectly (e.g., browser mediation) collaborate. This<br>
enables the recovery mechanism for a user to sign in to their existing account<br>
on RP in a few important situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>A browser that implements FedCM but does not have access to the original<br>
certificate database (e.g., a fresh install). This mediated recovery<br>
maintains IDP blindness.</li>
<li>A browser or agent (e.g., a mobile app) that does not implement FedCM<br>
protocol and OAuth flows are needed. Here the recovery code may be passed by<br>
the RP to the IDP which can authenticate the user and generate a regular JWT<br>
token. Notice that here <strong>IDP gets unblinded</strong> as it learns about the user<br>
sign-in to the RP.</li>
</ol>
<p>A random salt ensures that neither RP nor IDP is able to unblind themselves<br>
simply by enumerating all possible values.</p>
