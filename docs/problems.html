	<h1>Related Problems</h1>
<p>These are related problems with federation that browsers may be able to help with.</p>
<h2>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/toolkit/web/federated-login#the_nascar_page">NASCAR flag</a> problem</h2>
<p>Every website has a different sign-in process and has to show a list of supported identity providers for the users to choose. The user is left to determine which identity provider to use, which one they may have used last time, what might happen if they pick a different IDP this time, and what what data might get shared, typically without any support from the browser in remembering the user’s past choice or highlight relevant options. We believe that, by pulling some of the responsibility for the browser, we can offer a personalized IDP disambiguation UI which can lead to higher conversion rates, but yet maintain user privacy.</p>
<p><img src="static/mock12.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Although not directly related to federation per se, there exist a number of other authentication and identity related problems that are worth mentioning, which an be addressed by other efforts that may be related to, but pursued independently of efforts to improve federation.</p>
<h2>Identity Attribute Verification</h2>
<p>Verifying phone numbers and emails is tedious: currently, verification is often done manually by users without assistance from the browser or IDP. For example, to verify email addresses a service typically sends an OTP (one-time code) to the user’s inbox to be copied/pasted. Similarly, for phone numbers, an SMS message is sent to the user’s phone to be copied/pasted too. There are clear ways here where the browser can step in to help (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebOTP">WebOTP</a>), and it would generally preferable for authoritative identity providers to assert these attributes wherever possible.</p>
<h2>Cross device sign-in</h2>
<p>Because cookies are not propagated across devices, a user has to sign back in (and remember account info, etc) on new devices. Often they end up having to go through a recovery flow, creating a duplicate account, or abandoning completely. Identity providers play an important role in facilitating cross-device sign-in, but we may be able to solve this more generally for user irrespective of their chosen authentication mechanism by expanding on web platform functionality such as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/credential-management-1/">Credential Management API</a>.</p>
<h2>The Session State Opacity Problem</h2>
<p>Because session state management is implemented via general purpose low level primitives (namely, cookies), when users intend to “log-out” there are no guarantees that anything necessarily happens (e.g. the origin can still know who you are, but it can pretend it doesn’t). Only clearing all cookies currently guarantees that an origin is not <strong>adversarially tracking</strong> you post log-out. There are proposals such as <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/explainers/tree/master/IsLoggedIn">IsLoggedIn</a> to address this issue.</p>
