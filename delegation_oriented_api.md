# Delegation-oriented API

This approach attempts to provide technical enforcements of [Identity Provider
blindness](glossary.md#identity-provider-blindness) by having the IDP delegate
the generation of identity assertion to the browser.

Below is one variation that combines the IDP blindness mechanisms designed in
[Mozillaâ€™s Personas proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Persona)
with the [RP blindness](glossary.md#relying-party-blindness), recovery processes
and the user-behavior backwards compatibility. This approach maximizes the
technical enforcement of both RP and IDP tracking, at the cost of IDP and RP
server-side backwards compatibility.

## Basic Flow

Notice that in this approach we are assuming that an email proxy and email
provider exist independent from the IDP. This is necessary to maintain IDP
blindness even after RP uses the directed email address to email the user.

Below is the sign up flow in this proposal where a user signs up to an RP and
share their [directed basic profile](glossary.md#directed-basic-profile). The
importance of recovery code and salt are discussed in the next section.

**TODO**(majidvp): Explain in more details.

## Benefits

Maximum IDP and RP tracking preventions using technical enforcement.

From a UX perspective, we expect this to have the lowest privacy-introduced
friction/consent, since both RP and IDP tracking problems are addressed
mechanically.


## Challenges

### Server-side Backward compatibility

This approach requires changes in the RP backends:

- This approach requires a new token format which is no longer backward
  compatible with the OpenID JWT. This means that the token verification
  libraries on the RP backends need to be updated. While we can do our best to
  make the change small, all RPs are  still required to redeploy. In contrast,
  earlier explored flows only require IDP sdk and backend updates.
- The RP needs to maintain a recovery token for each account. This is necessary
  to enable the ability for users to sign-in to their account on platforms that
  don't have WebID or after they switch browsers.

### UX Complication

With this proposal the sign-in user experience on RP would remain the same in
particular a) users can sign in to RP by selecting an IDP and b) users can sign
in to their existing account with RP even on platforms that do not support WebID
by falling back to OpenID and removing IDP blindness restriction.

However the user experience on IDP side changes. In particular users are no
longer able to see and manage all the RPs they have signed up with through their
IDP control panel. Browsers may be able to provide a similar UX. Most likely
scenario is that both browser and IDP would end up managing some account which
can be a source of confusion.

### Decoupling the Email Proxy and the Email Provider

Most RPs send welcome email to their users on account creation. This can defeat
the IDP blindness if IDP is also the email proxy and provider. To mitigate this
we envision other parties to be responsible for proxying email (e.g., the
browser) and keeping the user inbox (e.g., an email provider). 


### RP account management complexity

Directed emails notably increase account management complexity for RPs since
many users are not be able to readily recall their directed email address. This
proposal adds even more complexity to this by introducing email proxy to the
mix.

## Technical Details


### IDP/RP Blindness Enforcement

- the IDP is not aware of the RP that the user is signing in. This is achieved
  by having the IDP certify a browser controlled public key whose private key
  can be used to mint new tokens on IDP's behalf.
- This enforced IDP blindness may be reverted when it becomes necessary. We
  belive one such necessary use case is to allow a user to sign in to their
  account on platforms that do not support WebID.
- the RP is always blind as it receives directed id and directed email.

### Databases

Here is the database for each of the participating entities.

* **Browser**: RP, IDP, global user id, private/public key pair, global email, directed email, salt, IDP certificate
* **Email Proxy**: directed email, global email
* **IDP**: user id, directed id, directed email, public key, salt
* **RP**: directed email, directed id, recovery code


### RP Backend Verification

Normally the RP verifies the JWT on its backend by checking its signature
against the IDP public key. However the new proposed Certified JWT contains, in
its header, a browser generated public key which is certified by the IDP. So the
verification process first verifies the included public key with the IDP public
key and then verifies the token using this public key.


Here is a strawman proposal for a Certified JWT token:

```js

{
  header: {
    "alg": "ES512",
    "typ": "JWT",
    /* new entry in header */
    "certified-public-key": {
      "value": "MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG",
      "signature":  ECDSASHA512(
          "<value>",
          "<idp-private-key>"
      ),
    }
  },
  payload: {
    "sub": "1234567890",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "admin": true,
    "iat": 1516239022,
    /* new entry in payload */
    "recovery": ECDSASHA512("<user_id>", RP, "<salt>")
  },

  signature: ECDSASHA512(
    base64(header) + "." + base64(payload),
    "<browser-private-key>")
  }
}
```

### Recovery Flow

Recovery code is an opaque value that can be computed given user id, RP site,
and a salt value e.g., `recovery code = SHA512(user_id, RP, salt)`.

The recovery code is kept at the RP. But it may be passed to the IDP to uniquely
identify the user. This means that an RP and IDP may be able to identify the
user if they directly or indirectly (e.g., browser mediation) collaborate. This
enables the recovery mechanism for a user to sign in to their existing account
on RP in a few important situations:

 1. A browser that implements WebID but does not have access to the original
    certificate database (e.g., a fresh install). This mediated recovery
    maintains IDP blindness. 
 2. A browser or agent (e.g., a mobile app) that does not implement WebID
    protocol and OAuth flows are needed. Here the recovery code may be passed by
    the RP to the IDP which can authenticate the user and generate a regular JWT
    token. Notice that here **IDP gets unblinded** as it learns about the user
    sign-in to the RP.

A random salt ensures that neither RP nor IDP is able to unblind themselves
simply by enumerating all possible values.
