**TL;DR**; This is a **strawman proposal** for a new Web API to allow websites to keep using identity federation while the ecosystem [tightens up](https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/) privacy, namely making exchanging [global identifiers](README.md#rp-tracking-and-joinability) harder.

This proposal has two parts:

1. An API that websites (relying parties, or RPs) can use to [request the user's identity](#relying-party-api) and
1. An API that identity providers (IDPs) can use to [provide the user's identity](#identity-provider-api) and mechanism to declare their [privacy agreements](#well-knownwebid)

# Why?

Over the last decade, identity federation has unquestionably played a central role in raising the bar for authentication on the web, in terms of ease-of-use (e.g. passwordless single sign-on), security (e.g. improved resistance to phishing and credential stuffing attacks) and trustworthiness compared to its preceding common pattern: per-site usernames and passwords.

The standards that define how identity federation works today were built independently of the web platform, and their designers had to work **around** its limitations rather than extending them. Because of that, existing user authentication flows rely on general web capabilities such as top-level navigation, link decoration, window popups and cookies.

Unfortunately, these same **low-level** capabilities that facilitate cross-origin data transmission are increasingly being abused to pass identifying information about users without their knowledge or consent. Most notably, global identifiers (e.g. email addresses, usernames) can be used to **link accounts** when two or more relying parties collude.

This proposal provides a way forward for browsers to support federated identity over an explicit channel that will eliminate RP and IDP reliance on those lower level capabilities. From that baseline, the user agent will be better able to protect user privacy during authentication flows, and also the web platform can make privacy-enhancing changes without concern for breaking federated identity flows.

# Considerations

We would like to address a wide set of privacy and usability goals for identity sharing on the web, but this proposal is specifically designed and optimized for a plausible deployment strategy on the web, namely giving much consideration to **user acceptance** and **website adoption**.

A noteworthy observation of identity federation on the web today is that there are **relatively few public IDPs** in use (say, tens), particularly in comparison to the number of RPs (say, millions) and their users (say, billions). From that observation, it is clear to see that any deployment will be much easier if it only requires adoption by IDPs and no changes or engagement on the part of RPs. Fortunately, in more cases than not, RPs implement federated identity importing a script provided by - and under the control of - IDPs, giving us a major deployment vehicle: IDP SDKs loaded into RPs. Nonetheless, while much of the client side code is under the (few) IDPs to control (e.g. we can replace redirects by other means), all of the server side code is under the (many) RPs to control, meaning that that’s harder to change. The cases where RPs implement federated identity without a dynamically loaded SDK will have a longer deployment window and will be discussed separately. 

Likewise, changing user behavior and norms is hard because of the number of people involved (say, billions). Unfamiliar login flows could result in users declining to use federated options, and instead opting for username/password credentials during RP account creation. To address that, this proposal aims to provide an experience that minimizes the divergence from existing federated identity user experience as much it possibly can (e.g. introducing new user decisions to be made).

# Prior Art

By far, the closest analogy to this work is the great work of [BrowserID](https://github.com/mozilla/id-specs/blob/prod/browserid/index.md#web-site-signin-flow) during the [Mozilla Personas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Mozilla/Persona/The_navigator.id_API) effort (postmortem [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_AAR)). In many ways, the goals that BrowserID was trying to achieve as well as the mechanisms that were created are a lot alike what’s being proposed here. There are significant differences in strategy and design, but let’s start with the similarities first because there are many.

First, BrowserID was clearly trying to solve similar problems, namely IDP Tracking and friction. The mechanisms that were created clearly had [strong builtin privacy components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHpFwdQw2wQ) to prevent IDPs from knowing about RPs and vice versa, via the chain of signatures gathered from IDPs (mainly email providers) and certificates generated by the browser.

Second, from a mechanism perspective, there was clearly a separation between an RP to Browser API as well as a Browser to IDP API. 

```javascript
navigator.id.get((assertion) => {}, {
  backgroundColor: "#606B72",
  siteName: "My Example Site"
});
```

The [RP calls a browser native API](https://github.com/mozilla/id-specs/blob/prod/browserid/index.md#web-site-signin-flow) to fetch an assertion which gets mediated by the [browser in coordination with the IDP](https://github.com/mozilla/id-specs/blob/prod/browserid/index.md#identity-provisioning-flow).

```javascript
// set up UI
navigator.id.beginAuthentication(function(email) {
  // update UI to display the email address
});
```

The postmortem analysis [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_AAR) is very insightful in understanding what were the challenges faced and gives this proposal a solid place to work from. In many ways, we think some of these insights are rooted in the observation we made earlier about backwards compatibility with RPs and user’s current behavior, which we are deliberately trying to avoid. 

# Strawman Proposal

This strawman proposal is broken down into two parts:

1. An API that websites (relying parties, or RPs) can use to [request the user's identity](#relying-party-api) and
1. An API that identity providers (IDPs) can use to [provide the user's identity](#identity-provider-api) and declare their [privacy agreements](#well-knownwebid) (which informs the browser permission model) 

Together, they addresses the **classification problem**: they turn the current low-level primitives used in federation (namely, redirects, iframes and popups) into high-level primitives that make the exchange explicit and transparent to browsers.

In doing so, browsers can enforce that the appropriate level of awareness and consent is raised during the exchange. 

## The Baseline Proposal

The goal of the baseline proposal is to provide a **high-level**, identity-specific API that allows browsers to **classify** the otherwise **opaque** transactions that are enabled by low-level, general-purpose APIs (e.g. redirects).

By classifying as an identity data exchange, browsers can (a) provide high-level guidance to users regarding the consequences of the specific identity transaction and/or (b) demote / discourage / prevent the opaque data exchange (e.g. opaque link decoration). 
Currently, RP sign-in flows usually begin with a login screen that provides the user options to use federated identity, as illustrated in the mock below. Today, clicking the button for an IDP usually initiates a top-level navigation to a designated IDP sign-in page.

### Relying Party API

In this formulation, the redirect flow gets replaced by the invocation of a new **high-level** identity-specific API that enables RPs to request IdTokens. While largely to be determined, a good source of inspiration and analogy can be drawn from the PaymentsRequest API (it has similar UX flows, number of players and privacy requirements):

```javascript
// This is just a possible starting point, largely TBD.
let {idToken} = await new IdentityRequest({
  provider: "https://accounts.example.com",
  // other OpenId connect parameters
}).show();
```

Here is a declarative formulation that could potentially work too:

```html
<input type=”idtoken” provider=”https://accounts.example.com”>
```

In current flows this is done on the IDP’s page following a top-level navigation, but we suggest that it could be better placed in a popup window or a tab-modal dialog resembling what is used for PaymentHandler [windows](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-handler/#windows) or the proposed [modal-window](https://github.com/adrianhopebailie/modal-window/blob/master/explainer.md), for performing the Identity Provisioning Flow step that follows. The mock below shows an example of a bottom sheet that combines IDP-supplied and browser-supplied UI.

### Identity Provider API

With the IDP's endpoint loaded in a content area of their own control, it is the IDPs responsibility to navigate the user through their own consent flow. 

Once the IDP has gathered enough consent from the user, it uses a newly exposed JS API to inform the browser that an idtoken has been generated:

```javascript
// This API is still largely to be determined. But here is an idea
// to get the ball rolling:
new IdentityResponse().resolve(idToken};
```

#### `.well-known/webid`

Browsers intermediate the data exchange according to their assessment of the privacy properties involved: the more it believes that the exchange is respecting the user's privacy the less it has to raise the user's awareness of the perils involved (e.g. scary permission prompts). 
 
Browsers can use a variety of mechanisms to help them make an assessment:

- **IdToken introspection**: browsers could observe when global identifiers (e.g. email addresses) are being passed to different origins
- **Crypto**: browsers and IDPs could agree upon a one-way hash function to build verifiably directed identifiers (e.g. `HASH(GLOBAL_ID+ origin) == LOCAL_ID`).
- **Certification**: a neutral party could certify IDPs that comply to certain agreed upon rules.

We believe a combination of strategies are going to be involved, but it seems hard to escape some form of agreement on policy, specifically because of server-side collusion. So, as a starting point, this strawman proposal starts with a mechanism and convention that allows IDPs to explicit acknowledge certain service agreements.


```js
// Available on a .well-known/webid file:
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/webid",
  "@type": "IdentityProvider",
  "certificate": {
    "supports_ephemeral_emails": true,
    "shards_identifiers": true,
    "server_side_protections": true,
    ... TBD ...
    // possibly signed by a neutral authority that verifies the claims?
  }
}
```

IDPs host the `.well-known/webid` file to acknowledge and express agreement on privacy policies. Browsers load the file and inform the user accordingly.

Aside from the mechanisms, from a sequencing perspective, our intuition is that supporting directed identifiers by IDPs is:

1. philosophically desirable but
2. a large architectural change

Because of that, we imagine that the enforcement of these policies are going to be deployed in multiple phases in coordination with IDPs.
