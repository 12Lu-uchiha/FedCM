# Champions

Champions (or, frequently "champion groups" of several members) are authors and editors of proposals. The champion is responsible for the evolution of the proposal, at which point maintenance transfers to the editor group. Champions have admin permissions in the proposal repository and can freely make changes within this repository. Periodically, champions may bring their proposal guidance, for consensus on stage advancement.

> This is more or less based on the good parts of TC39's Process [here](https://tc39.es/process-document/).
